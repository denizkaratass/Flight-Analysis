# ✈️ Flight Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs a detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a massive aviation dataset containing over **300,000 flight records**. The main objective is to extract meaningful insights about airline market trends, flight durations, and booking patterns using statistical methods.

## 📊 Key Insights & Analysis
* **Data Processing:** Cleaned and structured raw flight data using **Pandas** for accurate analysis.
* **Market Trends:** Analyzed the distribution of flights across different airlines and cities.
* **Duration & Timing:** Investigated the relationship between flight duration and departure times.
* **Class Segmentation:** Compared **Economy** and **Business** class distributions to understand market segmentation.
* **Route Analysis:** Performed deep-dive analysis on high-traffic routes (e.g., Delhi to Hyderabad) to observe airline frequency and availability.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Python**
* **Pandas**
* **NumPy**
* **Seaborn & Matplotlib**
